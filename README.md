## FAQ

### Is the formatting shows up on the server?
> Short answer: **no**.\
This mod is client-side only, so the formatting shows up only for someone **who installed this mod**.
### Is this mod compatible with *X* mod?
> Any mod that doesn't change the chat input must work out of the box. \
Sadly, I can't guarantee a compatibility with any *"chat revamp"* mod, even with the flexible implementation of ***Colorful HEX***, as it's hard to test those things.

> **Anyway, you can try to do some tests with your favorite mods and send the results on GitHub.**
### Any new features?
> I do plan to add written books support but for now I just can't figure out how to edit the book's text :D\
**If you have any ideas - you can send it on GitHub.**
### Backports?
> I do plan to backport this mod for 1.19-1.19.2 but not for older versions.\
**Yes, *currently* this mod works only for 1.19.3.**

### FoRgE??
> Nah.
