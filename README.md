## FAQ

### Is the formatting shows up on the server?
> Short answer: **no**.\
This mod is client-side only, so the formatting shows up only for someone 
**who installed this mod**.
### Is this mod compatible with *X* mod?
> Any mod that doesn't change the chat input must work out of the box. \
Sadly, I can't guarantee a compatibility with any *"chat revamp"* mod,
even with the flexible implementation of ***Colorful HEX***, 
as it's hard to test those things.

> Anyway, you can try to do some tests with your favorite mods and 
**send the results on GitHub.**

> If you have any ideas - **you can send it on GitHub.**
### Backports?
